# 🎨 ArtSphere - Database Application Project

### 🙋‍♂️ By [Your Name]

## 🚀 Application Title
**ArtSphere: A Personalized Art Management Platform**

## 🎯 Application Purpose and Summary
ArtSphere is designed to enhance the art exploration and collection experience by allowing users to effortlessly track art pieces they encounter, manage their personal art collections, and discover new artworks. 🌟 It solves the common problem of losing track of art pieces visited or desired, creating a seamless connection between art enthusiasts and artworks across various museums and galleries, particularly focusing on museums located in New York City. 🗽

An exciting feature is the location-based notifications 📍—users can receive real-time alerts when they are near an art piece they have saved in their personal galleries, enhancing their museum visits.

## 📌 Proposed Entities
Initially, the application will focus on core entities such as Art Pieces 🖼️, Artists 👨‍🎨, Users 👥, Museums 🏛️, and Collections 📚. Each art piece will have attributes including ID, name/title, artist, image URL, creation year, and location. Artists will have their own detailed profiles linking back to their artworks. Museums will manage exhibition details and locations. Users will be able to maintain personal collections of favorite or visited art pieces, enabling deeper interaction and engagement. Additional entities like Exhibitions 🎟️, Categories 📂, and Reviews 🌟 may evolve as the project progresses.

## 🛠️ Proposed Technology Stack
- 🐍 **Programming Language:** Python
- 🌐 **User Interface:** Web Interface (React frontend)
- 📦 **Database Type:** SQLite
- 🚧 **Frameworks and Tools:** Flask (backend), React (frontend), Pandas (data manipulation)

## 👩‍💻 User Interaction and CRUD Operations
Users will interact with the ArtSphere application through a responsive web interface built with React, interacting seamlessly with Flask backend APIs:

- ➕ **Create:** Users can add new artworks to their personal collections through intuitive web forms.
- 🔍 **Read:** Users can search, filter, and view detailed information about art pieces through interactive pages.
